//! Batch send optimization for SRTLA connections
//!
//! This module implements packet batching inspired by Moblin's implementation:
//! - Buffers up to 16 data packets before sending (default Normal regime)
//! - Flushes on 15ms timer to ensure low latency
//! - Flushes each batch with a single `sendmmsg` (one syscall per batch)
//!
//! At 10 Mbps with ~1300 byte packets:
//! - Without batching: ~960 syscalls/second per connection
//! - With batching: ~60-67 batch sends/second per connection (~15x reduction)
//!
//! The syscall saving is the whole point of the queue, and until `sendmmsg`
//! landed it did not exist: `flush` looped over the queue issuing one `send`
//! per packet, so batching bought nothing but added up to `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`
//! of latency. Anything that trades scheduling quality for "batch integrity"
//! (holding the scheduler on one link so batches stay contiguous) is therefore
//! paying for a benefit that only exists while this stays a real batch syscall.
//!
//! ## Adaptive batch regimes
//!
//! Three regimes drive the size threshold based on observed link load:
//!
//! - `LowActivity` (≤ 500 kbps): batch=4. Less buffering per tick on
//!   idle links so a sudden burst flushes promptly.
//! - `Normal` (default, 500 kbps – 5 Mbps): batch=16. The proven
//!   Moblin sweet spot.
//! - `HighLoad` (> 5 Mbps): batch=32. Bigger batches amortise socket
//!   syscalls better; future sendmmsg work benefits more here.
//!
//! Flush interval stays at 15 ms across regimes — going longer on
//! idle links would add latency when traffic returns, going shorter
//! under load would defeat the syscall-amortisation we batch for.
//! The `set_regime` setter is called from `housekeeping` based on each
//! connection's `current_bitrate_bps` snapshot.
