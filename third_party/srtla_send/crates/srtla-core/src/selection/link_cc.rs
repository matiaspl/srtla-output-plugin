//! Per-link congestion-control soft cap.
//!
//! A small per-connection state machine that produces a `target_bps` —
//! a soft cap on the rate the scheduler should push down this link.
//! `target_bps` is consumed by Enhanced selection (the soft-cap score
//! multiplier and the BDP in-flight cap), and the sustained `loss_degraded`
//! latch feeds the routing loss gate. The instantaneous `BackingOff` state
//! drives this controller's own bitrate backoff but does not gate routing.
//!
//! ## State machine
//!
//! Three states cover the practical regimes for a SRTLA soft cap:
//!
//! - **Climbing**: RTT stable, and no loss that we caused. Additively
//!   grow `target_bps`. Step is bounded by current cap and the link's
//!   measured throughput so it doesn't run away on idle links.
//! - **Holding**: RTT inflating but no loss yet (delay-based signal of
//!   approaching congestion). Hold target, don't grow.
//! - **BackingOff**: Loss observed (NAK rate up) *while we were driving
//!   the link hard enough to have caused it*. Multiplicative decrease,
//!   floored at measured throughput.
//!
//! Three states cover the steady-state, the bufferbloat-onset state,
//! and the loss state — which is what matters for a soft cap.
//!
//! ## Only back off for loss you caused
//!
//! Loss is not by itself evidence of congestion. A cellular link at the
//! cell edge sits at a percent or two of wire loss indefinitely, no
//! matter how little we send down it. A soft cap cannot repair that
//! loss, so reacting to it is pure downside: the decrease compounds for
//! as long as the loss lasts, and loss that outlives the backoff drives
//! the cap to the floor, where the BDP in-flight cap deselects a link
//! that was carrying real traffic.
//!
//! Three guards keep the decrease honest. Each covers a case the others
//! cannot, and all three were needed before a link with steady wire loss
//! stopped being ratcheted to the floor on a real netem run.
//!
//! - `BACKOFF_MIN_LOAD_PERMILLE` gates *entry*. A link we are barely
//!   feeding cannot be the cause of its own loss, so it never backs off.
//!   This is the only guard that helps a **starved** link: one carrying
//!   nothing has no throughput signal for the other two to reason from.
//!
//! - The **delivered floor** bounds the *depth*: never cap a link below
//!   the rate it is visibly sustaining. This is the load-bearing one,
//!   and the reason is easy to get backwards. `target_bps` **does not
//!   pace**. It steers the scheduler between links; it does not throttle
//!   this one. So a cut does not reduce what this link sends, and
//!   measured throughput does *not* follow the cap down. A cap under
//!   proven delivery is not a conservative estimate, it is a wrong one,
//!   and nothing about it self-corrects — so the decrease compounds
//!   until it hits `MIN_TARGET_BPS`. Under genuine congestion the floor
//!   still converges, because there a cut steers traffic *off* the link,
//!   throughput really does fall, and the floor follows it down.
//!
//! - `BACKOFF_EFFICACY_TICKS` bounds the *duration*: if a ~39% cut has
//!   not moved the loss, stop attributing it to ourselves
//!   (`loss_uncongestive`) and let the link climb again. Congestive loss
//!   responds to a lower offered rate; wire loss does not.
//!
//! The verdict expires only on `LOSS_UNCONGESTIVE_RETEST_TICKS`, or when
//! the loss regime ends. It deliberately does **not** expire on RTT
//! inflation. That was tried, on the theory that RTT is congestion
//! evidence independent of the loss signal, and it re-opened the backoff
//! path on every inflated tick: the controller alternated
//! `BackingOff → Drain → BackingOff`, cut on nearly all of them, and
//! ratcheted to the floor exactly as if the latch did not exist.
//! Congestion visible in RTT is already handled by `Drain` and
//! `Holding`, which are untouched by any of this — the loss path does
//! not need to double up on it.
//!
//! ## Age-bucketed RTT EWMA
//!
//! EWMA weight banded by time-since-last-sample to stay responsive
//! after stale periods. Power-of-2 ratios `1:1, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16` at age
//! bands `>= 2s, >= 1s, >= 500ms, >= 250ms`. After 2s with no sample we
//! reset to the new sample verbatim.
//!
//! All numbers here are starting points; soak data may suggest
//! retuning.
