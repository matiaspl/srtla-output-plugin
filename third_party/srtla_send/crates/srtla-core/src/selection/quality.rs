//! Quality scoring for enhanced mode connection selection
//!
//! This module calculates quality multipliers based on NAK history, RTT, and connection age.
//!
//! ## Performance Optimization
//!
//! Quality multipliers are cached per connection and recalculated every 50ms to avoid
//! expensive `exp()` calculations on every packet. This reduces CPU overhead by ~2-5%.
