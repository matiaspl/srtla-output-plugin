//! Connection selection strategies for SRTLA bonding
//!
//! This module provides two connection selection strategies:
//!
//! ## Classic Mode
//! Matches the original C implementation exactly:
//! - Simple capacity-based selection
//! - No quality awareness
//! - Pure "pick highest window/(in_flight+1)" algorithm
//!
//! ## Enhanced Mode
//! Improved selection with quality awareness:
//! - Exponential NAK decay (smooth ~8s recovery)
//! - NAK burst detection and penalties
//! - RTT-aware scoring (small bonus for low latency)
//! - Hysteresis (10%) to prevent flip-flopping

/// Drive every link's stall latch and fast silence pull, and recompute its
/// `stall_gated` flag.
///
/// Two tiers share the flag. The sticky latch
/// ([`SrtlaConnection::update_stall_latch`]) engages the instant
/// [`SrtlaConnection::is_stalled`] fires and releases only after a sustained
/// run of fresh delivery proof. The fast silence pull
/// ([`SrtlaConnection::is_briefly_silent`]) is transient: a loaded link that
/// has heard nothing for ~2 RTTs is skipped right now and readmitted the
/// moment any byte arrives — it reacts an order of magnitude sooner than the
/// latch, so a sub-second stall (a HARQ pause, a handover) stops receiving
/// payload almost immediately instead of for the whole staleness window.
///
/// A link is gated only when at least one un-latched, un-pulled schedulable
/// link exists to carry the traffic. That "any healthy" guard guarantees we
/// never gate the last usable link, so the mode selectors can treat a gated
/// link as unschedulable without a fallback pass. When the guard is off,
/// flag, latch, and pull are all cleared, restoring byte-for-byte baseline
/// selection.
///
/// Also refreshes each link's `conn_timeout_ms` and `delay_budget_ms` from the
/// snapshot, so the runtime-tunable liveness window and the peer's declared
/// receive buffer reach `is_timed_out` and `update_stall_latch` callers that do
/// not carry a config.
