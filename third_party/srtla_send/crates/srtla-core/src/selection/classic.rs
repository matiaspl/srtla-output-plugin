//! Classic connection selection algorithm
//!
//! This module implements the original SRTLA connection selection logic
//! that matches the C implementation exactly.
//!
//! Selection criteria:
//! - Pure capacity-based: score = window / (in_flight + 1)
//! - No quality awareness (no NAK penalties)
//! - No RTT consideration
//! - Simple "pick highest score" algorithm

use crate::connection::SrtlaConnection;

/// Select best connection using classic SRTLA algorithm
///
/// Returns the index of the connection with the highest capacity score,
/// or None if all connections are timed out or disconnected.
///
/// This matches the original C implementation's behavior exactly.
/// No time-based dampening or hysteresis is applied in classic mode.
