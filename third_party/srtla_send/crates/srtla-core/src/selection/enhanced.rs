//! Enhanced connection selection algorithm
//!
//! This module implements the enhanced SRTLA connection selection with:
//! - Quality-aware scoring based on NAK history
//! - RTT-aware bonuses for low-latency connections
//! - Score hysteresis to prevent flip-flopping (10%)
//!
//! The enhanced mode provides better connection quality awareness while
//! maintaining natural load distribution across all connections.
