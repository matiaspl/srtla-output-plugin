//! Critical-packet priority sidecar.
//!
//! srtla_send's scheduler normally picks a link per packet by quality /
//! capacity / RTT. An upstream encoder that knows it is about to push a
//! keyframe (IDR / SPS / PPS burst) can open a short "critical window"
//! during which the scheduler routes packets to the highest-quality link
//! instead. This gives must-land video data the most reliable path at
//! the moment it matters most.
//!
//! The window is signalled over a dedicated UDP sidecar socket rather
//! than the JSON-RPC control channel. Same-host loopback UDP shares the
//! network stack path with the actual SRT data, so priority events are
//! ordered tightly against the packets they describe. The out-of-band
//! JSON-RPC socket, by contrast, could arrive microseconds late and miss
//! the earliest critical packets.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! One request per UDP datagram, 5 bytes fixed:
//!
//! ```text
//! byte 0 : 0xC1 — magic / version tag ("Critical v1")
//! bytes 1..5 : u32 big-endian — window length in milliseconds
//! ```
//!
//! srtla_send stores `now + window_ms` as the critical deadline.
//! `is_critical_now()` returns true while `now < deadline`. Overlapping
//! windows extend the deadline monotonically (fetch_max) so a fresh
//! hint can only ever push the deadline forward, never shrink it.
