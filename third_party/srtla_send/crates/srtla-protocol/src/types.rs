/// matters: every *non*-retransmitted data packet feeds the reorder-hold
/// estimator, which measures the transit spread between bonded links and delays
/// loss reports by up to that spread. A probe from a link running a second
/// behind therefore pins the receiver's NAK hold near its ceiling — slowing
/// recovery of genuine losses on the *healthy* links — even though the probed
/// link carries no unique payload, so no gap will ever be filled by waiting for
/// it. Flagged as a retransmit, the probe is excluded from that estimator, and
/// from the reorder-tolerance ratchet on a stock receiver.
