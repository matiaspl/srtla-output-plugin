/// *also* queued on each held-out link. The copy reuses the original SRT
/// sequence number: the SRT receiver dedups it, so a lost or late probe can
/// never stall the receiver buffer, while a delivered one earns the link an
/// SRTLA ACK on its own socket — both the sustained delivery proof the rejoin
/// dwell requires and (since the ACK carries a round trip) the RTT sample the
/// recovery decision reads.
///
/// Covers both reasons a link is held out: the stall gate, and the quality
/// exclusion for a link that is *late* rather than merely under-used. The
/// distinction matters — a late link must not be given unique payload at all,
/// because a sequence number committed to a path running a second behind is
/// precisely the hole the receiver's reorder buffer stalls on, so the trickle
/// that keeps it measurable has to be redundant.
///
/// Deliberately NOT inserted into `seq_tracker`: the tracker must keep mapping
/// the sequence to the link that carried the unique copy, so a NAK still
/// penalizes the link that actually lost stream data. The SRTLA ACK for the
/// probe attributes correctly because `process_connection_events` matches the
/// arrival link first, and the probe is recorded in that link's own
/// sweep-proof probe log (see `SrtlaConnection::queue_probe_packet`) rather
/// than the packet log a cumulative ACK would prune it from.
