//! Shared statistics for external telemetry consumers.
//!
//! Exports per-link metrics via the Unix socket `stats` command for external
//! consumers like gst-app's bitrate controller.
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! 1. **Raw metrics only**: Export values directly from `SrtlaConnection` without
//!    transformation or speculation. Let consumers decide how to interpret them.
//!
//! 2. **Match established formats**: Per-link metrics align with `ConnectionInfo`
//!    (the extended keepalive format sent to srtla_rec).
//!
//! 3. **Include quality_multiplier**: This is the exact value used by enhanced/
//!    rtt-threshold selection algorithms, useful for understanding sender behavior.
//!
//! 4. **Simple aggregates**: Only sums and counts, no derived calculations like
//!    "capacity estimation" that would require assumptions about packet sizes.
