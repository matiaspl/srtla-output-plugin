//! Tests for the stalled-link deselect guard (`stall_deselect`, default on).
//!
//! The guard excludes a link whose in-flight backlog is high while its last
//! delivery proof (earned-ACK or keepalive-RTT sample) has gone stale, but only
//! when a healthier link can carry the traffic. It is a selection penalty only:
//! it never mutates liveness state. Gating latches asymmetrically: it engages
//! the instant the stall signal fires, and releases only after an
//! uninterrupted run of fresh delivery proof spanning the rejoin dwell (no
//! blind reprobe, no single-sample flap). The staleness window is
//! RTT-adaptive between a floor and the configured ceiling.
