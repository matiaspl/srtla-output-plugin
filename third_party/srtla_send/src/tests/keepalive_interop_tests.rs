//! Keepalive interop conformance.
//!
//! Pins the keepalive divergence with the reference srtla receiver and the
//! defensive-parse contract that lets the two interoperate:
//!
//! - A reference srtla receiver may send a *bare* 2-byte keepalive: the type
//!   only (`htobe16(SRTLA_TYPE_KEEPALIVE)`), no timestamp.
//! - This sender uses a timestamped keepalive: a standard 10-byte frame (type +
//!   `u64` ms timestamp) and a backwards-compatible *extended* 38-byte frame
//!   (timestamp + a `0xC01F`-tagged `ConnectionInfo` telemetry trailer).
//!
//! These tests assert (a) our extended keepalive builds → parses → preserves its
//! RTT fields end-to-end through the real receive path, and (b)/(c) that a bare
//! 2-byte echo, and any truncated/oversized frame, is handled gracefully (no
//! error, no panic). They do not change the wire format.
